This software is intended to be a software lighting controller inspired by DMX512. It provides a user-friendly interface for controlling lighting fixtures and creating dynamic light shows.

Our technology stack includes: Vue 3, Quasar Framework, SCSS, lodash-es, Electron (backend in `src-electron/` only)

Vue and Pinia reactivity are auto-imported in all components.

We use Yarn 4 for package management.
